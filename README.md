This study analyzes an fMRI dataset in order to see if a model can be trained to differentiate human neural response patterns to visual food and non-food object stimuli.

"Can we taste with our eyes?" is our final group project for "Decoding the Brain: Multivariate Analysis in Cognitive Neuroscience", taught by Dr. Yuan Tao in Fall 2018.
This repository contains all scripts used to conduct pre-processing and analysis.
